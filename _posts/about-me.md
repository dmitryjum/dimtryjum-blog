Hi, I’m Dmitry! I’m a full-stack software engineer with a decade of experience building web applications, smart contract systems, and real-time platforms. My expertise lies in frameworks like Ruby on Rails, React.js, and Next.js, and I’ve recently expanded into blockchain development with Solidity. I’ve spent most of my professional life in New York City, where I gained invaluable experience working in a fast-paced tech environment. Currently, I’m based in the Seattle area, but I still maintain strong ties to NYC and visit the city very often, I’m equally open to opportunities in NYC or remote roles. I’m passionate about crafting solutions that make an impact, from designing user experiences to deploying scalable, reliable systems. Whether working independently or on a team, I thrive in environments where creativity meets cutting-edge technology. Let’s build something amazing together!
