IVFQC (Althea Science) is dedicated to developing specialized applications for the IVF community, serving embryologists, geneticists, and healthcare professionals. The company focuses on two main applications: Generations, for IVF process tracking, and Reflections, for laboratory quality control and reporting.


## My Role and Contributions

During my time as a Remote Contract Software Engineer (March - August 2019), I worked on both the Generations and Reflections applications, implementing critical features and improvements.

### Key Achievements

#### Offline Data Handling
- Developed a robust data persistence system using browser's LocalStorage
- Implemented request queuing for unstable internet connections
- Ensured zero data loss during connectivity issues

#### Security Enhancements
- Created a Session Monitor feature for both applications
- Implemented user alerts for expiring sessions
- Added automatic sign-out functionality for inactive sessions

#### Application Improvements
- Initiated internationalization of Reflections to Russian and Spanish
- Implemented Rails I18n gem for language support
- Refactored existing features for better performance
- Created new database queries for statistical data extraction

## Technical Stack

The applications were built using:
- Ruby on Rails
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- LocalStorage API
- Rails I18n

## Conclusion

Working at IVFQC allowed me to contribute to meaningful healthcare applications while implementing critical features for data integrity and user experience. The role demanded careful attention to detail and robust solution design, particularly for offline functionality and session management.
