Invibox represented an innovative approach to email management, offering users unprecedented control over their inbox through custom filtering capabilities. As a startup focused on reimagining email handling, Invibox combined modern web technologies with traditional email protocols to create a unique user experience.


## The Technical Stack

The platform was built on a modern technology stack that included:
- Meteor.js as the primary framework
- MongoDB for data storage
- AWS SES for outgoing email handling
- Haraka SMTP server with custom Node.js plugins for incoming messages

## My Role and Contributions

During my time at Invibox (July - September 2014), I served as a Full Stack Web Developer in a small but dynamic team. As the primary developer, I faced the challenge of working with an existing Meteor.js codebase that lacked documentation, requiring both technical skill and investigative ability to understand and improve the system.

### Key Achievements

#### Core Functionality Improvements
- Fixed critical bugs in message management systems:
  - Message deletion functionality
  - Unwanted email address blocking
  - Contact group management

#### Calendar Integration
- Implemented a comprehensive calendar feature using FullCalendar jQuery plugin
- Developed functionality for event creation, editing, and different calendar views
- Successfully adapted the plugin to work within the Meteor.js ecosystem

#### Email Processing Infrastructure
- Completed development of a crucial Haraka SMTP server plugin for handling incoming messages
- Implemented conversation creation and MongoDB storage functionality
- Ensured real-time updates using Meteor.js's reactive programming model

## Conclusion

My time at Invibox, though brief, provided valuable hands-on experience with real-time web applications and email processing systems. The challenges of working with an undocumented codebase and implementing complex features helped develop both technical skills and problem-solving abilities that would prove valuable in future roles.
